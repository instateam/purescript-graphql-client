# purescript-graphql-client

### TODO:

1. circular input objects? do we want that? (use newtype if we want)
2. mutations
3. subscriptions
4. resolve import warnings (requires automatic imports generation)


### Inspiration

- port of https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-graphql/
- was based originally on https://github.com/dyerw/purescript-fernet
